# Salon-Database
Salon Database
I uploaded both salon and salon(2) which is the final version of the test solution.
While working on salon.sh I understood that the assignment didn't require a case selection with different menus as in the bike shop tutorial.
Still I realized that it would have worked and so finished passed the test with the solution in salon.sh file.
Then after finishing the solution I refactored the code as in file salon.sh(2)

Both solutions contain a minor bug, the name of the client has one extraspace when the phone number and the name are already present in the database.
If the phone number is not present and the input for name is requested than there is only one space between the comma and the <name>, otherwise there are 2 spaces.
